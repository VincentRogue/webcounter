# webcounter
A simple counter on a webpage that uses "-" and "+" with colors.
Positive values are green, negatives are red, and zero is black.
I have added a +/-10 function and multiply/divide.

I used a tutorial to make this, and the credit goes to freeCodeCamp.org on Youtube.

I did not edit any CSS, only the JavaScript and HTML.
